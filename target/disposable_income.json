    "description": "# Income Verification\nThe Disposable/Discretionary Income Verification endpoint enables the retrieval of aggregated income and expense data for users in real-time, facilitating the analysis of their liquidity.\nThe following terminology is used for this product:\n  1. **Income/Expense stream** is a set of transactions that belong to the same category and payment partner, i.e. a salary payment (category Salary) from a company Acme, Inc. (payment partner).\n  2. **Regular expenses** are considered to be expenses that occur on a regular schedule, it could be monthly, quarterly or even a yearly schedule, for example a monthly rent payment.\n  3. **Variable expenses** are expenses that are not done on a regular schedule, such as grocery shopping or a visit to the cinema.\n  4. **Disposable income** is the amount of income left after deducting regular expenses.\n  5. **Discretionary income** is the amount of income left after deducting both regular and variable expenses.\n\n## Onetime Income Report\\n\\nFollow these steps to perform Disposable/Discretionary Income Verification using the widget:\n1. Start the generation of an income report by calling this endpoint to create a widget link. You will receive a JSON payload with a field `location` in it.\n2. Forward the user to the `location` provided in the above response.\n3. The user will then be redirected to the `redirect_uri` provided in step 1. The request contains following query-parameters\\n    - `state`: The state that was provided when creating the widget link, which is used to identify a particular income report process on your side.\n  - `success`: Indicating if the account connection was successful.\n  - `code`: The authorization code to be processed by you. `code` is only returned on a successful flow.\n  - `flow_id`: This is the `id` returned in step 1 and is provided in case you do not want to keep any state on your side, but still want to be able to fetch the income report in step 5.\n4. Exchange the [authorization code for an access token](https://docs.finx.qwist.cloud/#operation/createAccessToken).\n5. Fetch the income report using the access token.\\n6. An income report can be fetched using the following filters provided in the query:\n  - `since` - the start date of the period for which the report will be generated\n  - `until` - the end date of the period for which the report will be generated\n  - `accounts` - list of accounts that shall be included in the report\n  - `accesses` - list of accesses that shall be included in the report \n\nPlease refer to [fetch accounts](https://docs.finx.qwist.cloud/#tag/Accounts/operation/listAccounts) on how to get the accounts and to [fetch accesses](https://docs.finx.qwist.cloud/#tag/Accesses/operation/listProviderAccesses) on how to get available accesses of a user.\n\n### Interaction with the UI:\n  - Select Mockbank Decoupled/Embedded\n  - Enter `figo01` and `654321` as username and password\n  - Select Auth method by phone\n  - Enter `123456` as OTP\n  - Select accounts for the income report\n  - Copy the URL to `callback_url`\n  - Call Exchange OAuth code\n  - Call Get income report\""
